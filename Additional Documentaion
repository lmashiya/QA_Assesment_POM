Documentation: Factorial Calculator Web Application
This document outlines the functionalities, limitations, and testing procedures for the factorial calculator web application.

Functionalities:

The application calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer entered by the user.
It displays an error message for negative number inputs, as factorials are not defined for them.

Limitations:

The application might not calculate factorials of very large numbers accurately due to potential overflow issues depending on the data type used for calculations.
Testing Procedures:

Several test cases have been designed to ensure the application's functionality:

Test Case ID: TC-001 - Validates factorial calculation for a positive integer (e.g., 5).
Test Case ID: TC-002 - Verifies error handling for a negative number input.
Test Case ID: TC-003 - Tests calculation accuracy for a large number (e.g., 15). This case also considers the possibility of an informative message being displayed for very large factorials instead of an exact result.
Additional Notes:

The user interface consists of a text box for input, a calculate button to trigger the calculation, and a display area for the result.
