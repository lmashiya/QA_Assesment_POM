1. Write a locator (CSS selector/XPath) for the red form validation styling

Done is the locators file, utils/locators.py

2. Find the console message printed

Hello! I am in the done part of the ajax call

3. Write a Selenium script to test that the factorial of 7 is 5040

Done. tests/test_Factorial.py

5. Write a bug report

Bug Report: Factorial Calculator Web Application
Bug Summary:

The factorial calculation function produces incorrect results for factorials of large numbers.

Expected Behavior:

The application should accurately calculate the factorial of any non-negative integer entered by the user.

Actual Behavior:

When the user enters a large number (typically exceeding 12 or higher), the calculated factorial value becomes inaccurate or overflows.

Steps to Reproduce:

Open the factorial calculator web application.
Enter a large positive integer in the text box (e.g., 15, 20).
Click the "Calculate" button.
Observe that the displayed factorial value is incorrect or an error message appears.
Additional Information:

Browser: [Chrome, Firefox]
Operating System: Windows 10
Severity: High (This bug prevents the core functionality of the application for larger factorials.)
Possible Solution:

The application could implement error handling for potential overflows by using data types with larger capacity or handling the calculation differently for very large factorials.


6. Document a test case

Test Case: Factorial Calculation - Large Number
Test Case ID: TC-003

Description: This test case verifies if the application calculates the factorial of a large number accurately.

Pre-Conditions:

The factorial calculator web application is open.
Test Data:

Input Value: 15 (or any other large positive integer)
Test Steps:

Enter the test data value (15) in the text box.
Click the "Submit" button.
Expected Result:

The application should display the correct factorial value for 15, which is 1,307,674,368,000.
Alternatively, an informative message can be displayed indicating the limitations of calculating very large factorials.
Pass/Fail Criteria:

The test case passes if the displayed factorial value matches the expected result (1,307,674,368,000) or an appropriate message is shown for very large factorials.
The test case fails if the displayed value is incorrect or an unexpected error message appears.
Additional Notes:

This test case can be repeated with different large positive integers to ensure consistent behavior.
The expected result value (1,307,674,368,000) may vary depending on the data type used for calculations. It's important to consider the application's limitations for handling very large factorials.


7. Include test coverage




8. Add any documentation that might be necessary to explain your process, include this in a file in the repo.
